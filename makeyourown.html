            How do you start?
        </h2>

        <p>
			You can make a roguelike in any programming language: <strong><i><a href="https://github.com/munificent/hauberk">Hauberk</a></i></strong> 
			was	written in Google's web application language Dart, while <strong><i><a href="https://github.com/Octachron/roguetype">Roguetype</a></i></strong>
			was written in the memory safe buisiness language OCaml!
			<br>
			<br>
			The easiest way to start though is to use Python and <strong><a href="https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod">libtcod</a></strong>, a
			library that gives you all of the tools you need.

		<h5>A video by the creator of <i>Cogmind</i> detailing how to get started on making a roguelike. Almost everything I want to say
		is in this video.</h5>
		<p>
			The way to learn is to go out and make things. I hope this page gave you a place to start, and good luck!

			Roguelikes to try
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://github.com/tmewett/BrogueCE/releases"><strong><i>Brogue</i></strong></a> is a great introduction to
				roguelikes, and is somewhat minimalistic while still being fun. And it's <a style="color:#51c44d">free!</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				If ASCII graphics aren't your fort√©, maybe you'll enjoy <a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com/"><strong><i>Caves of Qud</i>
				</strong></a>, a deep roguelike with factions, fungal infections, and a bit of time travel. It's going to set you back about
				 <a style="color:#ff0b0b">$30</a> though.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://crawl.develz.org/play.htm"><strong><i>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</i></strong></a> is like a classic 1990s 
				roguelike, but with non ASCII graphics and playable in your browser. And it only comes at the low low price of... 
				<a style="color:#51c44d">free!</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"><strong><i>Dwarf Fortress</i></strong></a> has ascended beyond a game into a 
				partical accurate simulation.
				<br>
				That is only half a joke. Dwarf Fortress has two modes, one where you command a fortress and the dwarves within, called 
				Fortress Mode, and the roguelike mode, Adventure mode, which is what is relevant for this site. These modes are 100% 
				compatible, so if you have a fortress you can create a character and visit it (or plunder it!). There is no such thing as HP, 
				instead all entities including the player have simulated tendons, bones, organs, and muscles that can be bruised, torn, or 
				broken. Armor doesn't reduce damage flatly, instead the metal of the armor has a level of hardness and shock absorption. 
				Also there are eight different types of clay generated accurately in their respective soil layers. I could have made this 
				entire website about Dwarf Fortress...
				<br>
				The original version is <a style="color:#51c44d">free</a>, while the Steam version, which has graphics and sound effects,
				costs <a style="color:#ff0b0b">$30</a>. Both have the same content and are recieving new updates, and you can add graphics 
				to the free version via tilesets.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://kyzrati.itch.io/polybot-7"><strong><i>Polybot7</i></strong></a> is the <a style="color:#51c44d">free</a>
				alpha version of Cogmind, originally created as an entry to the 
				<strong><a href="https://7drl.com/">7 day roguelike challenge</a></strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				As you can see by how many times I've mentioned it, I recommend <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/index.html">
				<strong>Cogmind</strong></a>. It costs <a style="color:#ff0b0b">$25</a>. Check out its video in <a href="videos.html">
				<strong>Suggested Viewing</strong></a> if you want to see what it's like.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, or don't, you might want to try <a href="https://rephial.org/"><strong><i>Angband</i>
				</strong></a>. It's a <a style="color:#51c44d">free</a> roguelike from 1992 based on a different roguelike,
				<i>Moria</i>, from 1988, where you go deeper and deeper into the mountains of Middle Earth to confront the evils hiding at
				the final floor.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://www.nethack.org/"><strong><i>NetHack</i></strong></a> released in 1987 as a roguelike where the core concept 
				is "If you can think it, you can do it." Want infinite food? Turn your enemies to stone with either spells or a cockatrice,
				then cast Stone to Flesh for an endless suply of meat! And you can do all of this for <a style="color:#51c44d">free!</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				How could I forget 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">
				<strong><i>Rogue</i></strong></a>, the game where it all began*, made by two nerds in a small town in California. It does show 
				its age, and plays like a beta of NetHack or Angband, but without Rogue leading the way neither of those games would have 
				existed. You can download the 
				<a href="https://archive.org/details/RogueTheAdventureGameV1.11984MichaelC.ToyKennethC.R.C.ArnoldAdventureRolePlayingRPG">
				<strong>DosBox archive</strong></a> for <a style="color:#51c44d">free</a>, or cough up <a style="color:#ff0b0b">$3</a>
				for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1443430/Rogue/"><strong>steam version</strong></a>.

			*Technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)"><strong><i>Star Trek</i></strong></a>, a fangame about
			the science fiction series made in 1971 was the first roguelike, followed by 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_Apple_Manor"><strong><i>Beneath Apple Manor</i></strong></a> in 1978. But the
			genre is called roguelike for a reason, Rogue popularized the genre. And no one wants to call them applelikes!
