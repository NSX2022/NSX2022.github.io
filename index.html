			Introduction to Roguelikes
		</h1>
		<p>
			What is a roguelike?

			First of all, it is my favorite genre of game! Second of all,
			this is a question that has puzzled enjoyers of the genre for years, as the
			term "Roguelike" gets applied to everything from the original Rogue to Fortnite.
		</p>
		<h3>
			What is a Roguelike?
		</h3>
		<p>
			Developers and players at the International Roguelike Development Conference of 2008
			argued for many hours about what defines a Roguelike, eventually deciding
			on 13 key factors, known as the <strong><a href="https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation">Berlin Interpretation</a></strong>:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The world of the game is randomly generated</li>
			<li>Death is permanent; you must create a new character after you die if you want to play again</li>
			<li>The game is turn based and grid based (like a board game)</li>
			<li>There is no meta progression; each new start is a blank slate with no impact from previous runs</li>
			<li>Actions are non-modal. You should be able to do any action regardless of game state <br> (e.g, choosing to fight in a shop)</li>
			<li>The game is complex enough to allow multiple solutions to the same problem (more on this later!)</li>
			<li>You have to manage your limited resources (e.g. food, healing potions) <br>
				and find uses for the resources you receive</li>
			<li>Killing hoards of enemies must be a part of gameplay</li>
			<li>The world must be explored carefully by the player (unless you want to become familiar with rule 2)</li>
			<li>The player controls a single character and the game is singleplayer</li>
			<li>Enemies abide by the same rules as players (They can cast fireballs and detonate bombs too,<br>
				 watch out!)</li>
			<li>The game is a tactical challenge, you have to learn and plan before you can make significant progress</li>
			<li>Graphics are minimal</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Naturally, much has changed since 2008, and these rules are now seen as guidelines rather than
			the law. Games that violate these rules (to a point) are seen as roguelikes by many:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Binding of Isaac</li>
			<li>Vampire Survivors</li>
			<li>Rogue Legacy</li>
			<li>Brotato</li>
			<li>Inscryption</li>
		</ul>
