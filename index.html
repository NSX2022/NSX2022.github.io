			Introduction to Roguelikes
		</h1>
		<p>
			What is a roguelike?

			First of all, it is my favorite genre of game! But on a serious note, <br>
			this is a question that has puzzled enjoyers of the genre for years, <br>
			as the definition gets applied to everything from the original Rogue to Fortnite.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Classic Roguelikes
		</h3>
		<p>
			Developers at the International Roguelike Development Conference of 2008 <br>
			argued for many hours about what defines a Roguelike, eventually deciding <br>
			on 13 key factors, known as the <a href="https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation">Berlin Interpretation</a>:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The world of the game is randomly generated</li>
			<li>Death is permanent; you must create a new character after you die if you want to play again</li>
		</ol>
